                    <h6>Care, Craft, Creativity, Connection.</h6>
                    <p>During my time as a UX Designer & Inclusive Web Developer at UC San Diego Library (‘23-’26), my supervisors introduced me to what was called the 4 C’s, as part of our team’s manifesto. Care means to attend to quality and detail in what you create because of the knowledge that you, other implementors, and users will return to that work again and again. Craft is sustaining and growing that quality of work over time, even when challenged. Creativity aligns with bravely sharing your craft, to refine it through collaboration. And connection means building bridges with teammates and users through your work to create collective impact.These values have since been ingrained in my design ethic.</p>
                    <h6>Sustainable Development.</h6>
                    <p>We’re in an age where increased energy consumption from global data centers is deeply impacting communities and the environment. When I learned about the “Sustainable Web Development” movement in 2024, and lead a web project exploring the topic for UC San Diego Library’s digital experience team, I subscribed to it. Now, I treat environmental impact as a KPI, and I utilize sustainable design hacks to scale up performance.</p>

                    <h6>Thinking globally, developing locally.</h6>
                    <p>Traveling to my family’s home province in Henan China, studying abroad in Edinburgh, Scotland, and working within the IT services space in Bangalore, India for a summer has helped me realize that there are common patterns in the pain points users across the world face, and similar practices that could be improved within web development to make sites better serve the World Wide Web. This global perspective informs each step of my development practice.</p>
